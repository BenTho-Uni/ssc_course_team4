# Team 4
Contributions of Team 4 for the sustainable programming course of the SSC

---

## Unit 1
|Name | Assigned Tasks |
| ------------- |:-------------:|
|Nils | Statistical Analysis Task 1 to 4|
|Marco | Numerical Analysis Task 3 to 6|
|Ben | Statistical Analysis Task 5, Numerical Analysis Task 1+2|

## Unit 2
Imperative, Procedural,
Programming Paradigm

### Sketch for planned functions
You can find the first sketch for the functions
[here](src/img/function_plan.pdf)

## ToDo
- [ ] Decide if better seperation of output functions in numerical.py and
      statistical.py worth
- [ ] Add inline commentary
- [ ] find out how to move test_statistical.py to tests folder without broken
      import call
- [ ] test_statistical.py: why filecmp not working?

## Requirements
These modules are written in python3, and require the following libs:
pandas, numpy, seaborn, matplotlib, pytest
